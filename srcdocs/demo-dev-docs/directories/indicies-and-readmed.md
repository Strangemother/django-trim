# An Index File

A directory within the target doc/ folder may have an _index_ page to automatically present when navigating or compiling the docs.

Apply a `readme.md` or `index.md` within a directory. If the directory has one file (like this one), the single file is presented.

If more than one file exists within the directory, you'll see a _generic indices_ page.

## Compiling

When compiling, the tool will create a `readme.md` in the target directory of the output folder.
