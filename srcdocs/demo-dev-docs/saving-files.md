# Saving Files

You can use the tool as a standard markdown editor, by pointing it at your target `docs/` (or any output directory and edit its markdown. Press publish whenever you're ready to produce a _site_.

1. run the tool in your target directory
2. When pressing save, opt to `save changes elsewhere`.

## Using the `md-1` Feature

This tools unique feature is to help you write your outbound markdown, so you may silently use _this_ tool when editing your documentation.

When save, output to another directory, bound to any other app.

1. Run the tool in your root directory
2. configure the "pre markdown" as content to edit
3. configure the "output directory" as your target


## Publishing

Honestly it's your choice, there's no reason why this tool can't be a _general markdown editor with bits_ (We all have our favourite chair).

That said you can absolutely use this as a markdown editor, and _publish_ a site.


## Erm - Why?

I wrote this tool to help solve a primary problem of _DRY_ components in all my markdowns. I use markdown in all sorts of places. such as:

+ Github "docs/"
+ Hugo "content"
+ Personal learning
+ Markdown Editor
+ Gitbook Editor
+ Just straight typing into a text file.

... I pick and choose my favourite for the day ...

So I write this, A micro translation tool, with a few useful features installed for free.
