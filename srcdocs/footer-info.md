## Philosophy

I aim for the _Trim_ philosophy "convenient and thoughtless" - where a function or method should be quick to type, until I'm ready to replace them with the django builtins.

Open-source is as much about collaboration and mutual respect as it is about code. As a project committed to this ethos, we promise to always recognize and credit contributions with gratitude and respect.

We value the thoughtfulness and care put into each contribution, not to reduce them to mere numbers or to brush them off with a cavalier _"...that’s what open source is..."_. A project thrives on its community’s spirit and collective efforts.
