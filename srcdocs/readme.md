title: Alpha File

This demo-dev-docs serves as a test and example for the trim docs tools.

This file serves as a static note for the source docs. I've chosen to split out the dev-demo-docs and the _real_ docs under this srcdocs.

The origin directory is irrelevant (it can be anywhere) - so this file is generally ignored by any renderer.
