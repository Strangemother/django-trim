# Trim TODO Lists.

Let's build an oblitory django todo list, focusing on trim components.
We'll enhance it by building a basic markdown todo thing.

## Step 1: The Model

A single model stores big an entry with a date and a user


## Step 2: A ListView

Now we use a ListView to present them

### The URL

We put the view on the end of a URL.

## Step 3: A Form

We'll accept a single entry for the form, we'll also make a markdown db caching.

### The URL

A url for the form page.


## Step 3.1: A Success Page

We can have a distinct success page. However our todo list will just head back to the list page, with a django message to be nice.

At this point we have a list of models, with a form to create new models.

Now we can sprinkle with markdown, css, and ajax for clickies.
