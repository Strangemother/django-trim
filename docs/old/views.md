# Views

`short.views` contains a range of view generators, to produce clean class based views automatically.

! Note:
  Be careful when implementing auto-views and auto-urls as they **will** expose urls you won't want in production.

Views are generated at runtime (before django loads) to act the same as physically typed classes.

The finished classes are:

+ Inheritable: You can extend upon these ghost classes
+ Importable: Import them as if they exist in the code
+ Inspectable: Generate Docs or use runtime inspectors against the classes
+ Independent injected: Run the crud_classes function from anywhere (such as a ready function)

> consider the `shorts.urls.as_templates()` for producing views for HTML files

## Generating Views:

In dev it would be nice to quickly spit out a model, with a Create, Read, Update, Delete viewset.

Within your app `views.py`, apply the magic methods:


_views.py_
```py
from short import views as shorts

shorts.crud_classes()
# shorts.history_classes()
```

This will produce all the listed views, for all discovered models, within this app.

You'll need URLs to match:

_urls.py_
```py
from short import grab_models, names, urls as shorts
# Our app usual components
from . import views, models

app_name = 'products'

urlpatterns = shorts.paths_default(views, grab_models(models),
    views=names.crud()# + names.history(),
)
```

And that's it. For all models within this app, we have a crud set:

```
    orgs/ company/list/ [name='company-list']
    orgs/ company/create/ [name='company-create']
    orgs/ company/update/<str:pk>/ [name='company-update']
    orgs/ company/delete/<str:pk>/ [name='company-delete']
    orgs/ company/detail/<str:pk>/ [name='company-detail']
```

## Overriding Views

When using the view generator _shorts_ will create a class and apply it to the
owning module. The new class exists as if the written by hand:

In `products.views`:

```py
from django.shortcuts import render # default import

from short import views as shorts
shorts.crud_classes()
```

This will generate a _create/detail/update/delete_ set of classes for each model
within `product.models`. Eventually you'll outgrow the default _shorts view_ and
apply your own:



In `products.views`:

```py
from django.shortcuts import render # default import

from short import views as shorts
from . import models # import the relative products.models module.


shorts.crud_classes()

class MyModelDetailView(shorts.DetailView):
    model = models.MyModel

    def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
        kwargs['foo'] = 'FOO'
        return kwargs

```

This will override any class generated by `shorts.crud_classes()`.  The call position
is not important as _shorts_ will detect the manual override:

In `products.views` (alternative for the above):

```py
from django.shortcuts import render # default import

from short import views as shorts
from . import models # import the relative products.models module.


class MyModelDetailView(shorts.DetailView):
    """Override short.short crud classes generate and replace the detail view
    for MyModel with this custom View.

    The template `templates/products/mymodel_detail.html` must exist.
    """
    model = models.MyModel


shorts.crud_classes() # Will detect MyModelDetailView and reuse it.
```


Or with less magic, Generate views for a single or many target models:

```py
# from django.shortcuts import render
from short import views as shorts
from short.models import grab_models
from . import models

# Generate class views for the Product model in this module ("product.views")
shorts.crud_classes(__name__, models.Product)

# Generate views for all models from the import:
shorts.crud_classes(__name__, grab_models(models))
```


## Implementing Views for a Model

In this example, we'll product a range of views for a single model.


+ Working with our custom app `orgs`, created with: `python manage.py orgs`
+ Your own templates are required `appname/templates/appname/modelname_viewname.html`


We start with a model in `models.py`:

```py
from django.db import models
from short import shorts

class Company(models.Model):
    name = shorts.chars(255)
    owner = shorts.user_m2m(related_name='company_owner')
    # All users associated with this company.
    people = shorts.user_m2m()
    created = shorts.dt_created()
    updated = shorts.dt_updated()
```

Then we need a view for the model (or many models). Within `views.py`:

```py
from django.shortcuts import render
from short import views as shorts

from . import models


# create Create, List, Update, Delete
shorts.crud_classes(__name__, models.Company)
```

Finally we bind those views to some urls. Within the `urls.py`:

```py
urlpatterns += shorts.paths_default(views, grab_models(models),
    views=names.crud()
)
```

this one is slightly _magic_, for it lists _names_ `list, create, update...` and
`shorts` is aware of the convention to provide the correct class inheritance.

This will produce a list of views for your model:

```
    orgs/ company/list/ [name='company-list']
    orgs/ company/create/ [name='company-create']
    orgs/ company/update/<str:pk>/ [name='company-update']
    orgs/ company/delete/<str:pk>/ [name='company-delete']
    orgs/ company/detail/<str:pk>/ [name='company-detail']
```

This app `orgs` should be installed and applied as an `include` within the
primary application routing `urls.py`

Import the include and use the name of the module as the url primary pattern:

Within your **primary url dispatch** (your main app `urls.py`), extend the existing
urlpatterns:


```py

urlpatterns = urlpatterns + [
    # For anything not caught by a more specific rule above, hand over to
    # Wagtail's page serving mechanism. This should be the last pattern in
    # the list:
    path("", include(wagtail_urls)),




    path("", IndexView.as_view()),
    # url('', include('social_django.urls', namespace='social'))
    path("pages/", include(wagtail_urls)),

] + includes(       # ... same as:
      'account',    # path("account/", include('account.urls')),
      'products',   # path("products/", include('products.urls')),
      'baskets',    # path("baskets/", include('baskets.urls')),
      'orgs',
    )
```

## Implementing Views for All Models

In the previous example the `views.py` captures one model, but you can perform the same on _all_ existing models.


Within your application `views.py` (in our case the `orgs` app):

```py
# from django.shortcuts import render
from short import views as shorts
from short.models import grab_models
from . import models


# Generate class views for the Product model in this module ("product.views")
# shorts.crud_classes(__name__, models.Product) # replace this

# Generate views for all models from the import:
shorts.crud_classes(__name__, grab_models(models))
```

### Understanding `crud_classes`

The `crud_classes` function produces runtime classes using meta-programming and inserts the finished product into a target module. Essentially `shorts` attempts to _write the real class_ into the module.

The finished classes are:

+ Inheritable: You can extend upon these ghost classes
+ Importable: Import them as if they exist in the code
+ Inspectable: Generate Docs or use runtime inspectors against the classes
+ Independent injected: Run the crud_classes function from anywhere (such as a ready function)

we pass `__name__` here to ensure the new classes are inserted into our target (runtime) module. This could also say:

```
shorts.crud_classes("product.views", grab_models(models))
```

## Implementing History Classes for Models


For a single

Generate the set of class based views for a single model for 'history' models:

+ ArchiveIndexView
+ DateDetailView
+ DayArchiveView
+ MonthArchiveView
+ TodayArchiveView
+ WeekArchiveView
+ YearArchiveView


_views.py_
```py
# from django.shortcuts import render
from short import views as shorts
from . import models

# Build many views for the single model
shorts.history(models.Product)

# Specify the target module (this one "products.views") and the views `date_field`
shorts.history(models.Product, __name__, date_field='created')
```

Apply a range of URLs for the history views. user `shorts.names.history()` for easy typing:

_urls.py_
```py
from django.urls import path

from short import grab_models, urls as shorts, names
from . import views, models

app_name = 'products'

urlpatterns = shorts.paths_default(views, grab_models(models),
    # names are lists of strings, we can append to the exist
    # (from the previous example)
    views=names.crud() + names.history(),
)
```
