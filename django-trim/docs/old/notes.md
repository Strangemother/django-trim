Future notes

prep the first commands for a new project

    py -m venv env
    env\Scripts\activate
    
    pip install portray

With a command line:

    short init
    short init -r src/requirements.txt
    short init --requirements-dir src/

Templates should exist somewhere easy; such as an online service.
