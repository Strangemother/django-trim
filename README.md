Django Trim complements Django's robust framework, offering a suite of tools that enhance and simplify the creation of URLs, forms, views, models, templates, and more.

+ Less typed text, same functionality
+ clear, predicable functional naming
+ Leverage conventions for faster prototyping
+ 100% compatible with existing Django components.

`django-trim` respects Django's core principles, adding a layer of convenience and efficiency for developers who love Django's power but want to type lss wrds.


## Setup

]
```

You're ready to go.


## Trim Examples

Django trim is a facade to the common features of Django providing a layer of sugar for all those daily components. Some quick examples to quickly trim your code:

+ Models
+ Views
+ Forms
+ URLs
+ Admin
+ Templates

`django-trim` shortcuts a wealth of fun django parts. All are designed to trim your code without effort.


### Models

At the top of the list is functional model fields. For instant and easy importing:


<table>
<thead><tr>
  <th align="left">Before</th>
  <th align="left">After</th>
</tr></thead>
<tbody><tr valign="top"><td>

```py
from django.db import models


class Musician(models.Model):
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    instrument = models.CharField(max_length=100)


class Album(models.Model):
    artist = models.ForeignKey(Musician,
                            on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    release_date = models.DateField()
    num_stars = models.IntegerField()
```

</td><td>


```py
from django.db import models
from trim.models import fields


class Musician(models.Model):
    first_name = models.chars(50)
    last_name = models.chars(50)
    instrument = models.chars(100)


class Album(models.Model):
    artist = models.fk(Musician)
    name = models.chars(100)
    release_date = models.dt()
    num_stars = models.int()
```

</td></tbody></table>


All fields exist, including complex types such as the _User_ Foreign Key, or even a `DateTime` _created_ and _updated_:

```py
from django.db import models
from trim.models import fields

class StockChange(models.Model):
    user = fields.user_fk()
    stockcount = fields.fk(StockCount)
    from_count = fields.int(0)
    to_count = fields.int(1)
    created, updated = fields.dt_cu_pair()
```


### Forms

Trim your form definitions with `trim.forms.fields`. They're exactly the same fields as the original, but with less text!


```py
from django import forms
from trim.forms import fields

class ContactForm(forms.Form):
    sender = fields.email(required=False) # EmailField
    cc_myself = fields.bool_false() # A boolean field if `False` prepared
    subject = fields.chars(max_length=255, required=False) # CharField
    message = fields.text(required=True) # A ready-to-go CharField with a TextArea widget
```

### Views

Easy import (class based) views:

```py
from trim import views
from . import models

class MyModelListView(views.ListView, views.Permissioned):
    """A list view for all MyModels for users with admin mymodel "view" permission.
    """
    model = models.MyModel
    permission_required = ( 'stocks.view_mymodel')
```

### URLs

Excellently easy URLS defined as readable dictionaries:


<table>
<thead><tr>
  <th align="left">Before</th>
  <th align="left">After</th>
</tr></thead>
<tbody><tr valign="top"><td>
Using django's standard pattern for `urls.py`, it may look something like this:

```py
from django.urls import path
from .views import AboutView, ContactView, HomeView

app_name = 'website'

urlpatterns = [
    path("about/", AboutView.as_view(), name='about'),
    path("contact/", ContactView.as_view(), name='contact'),
    path("/", HomeView.as_view(), name='home'),
    path("<str:theme>/", HomeView.as_view(), name='home'),
]
```

</td><td>

The `urls.paths_named` accepts the `views` module, and all patterns as keyword arguments.

```py
from trim import urls
from . import views

app_name = 'website'

urlpatterns = urls.paths_named(views,
    about=('AboutView', 'sheet/<str:pk>/',),
    contact=('ContactView', 'contact/',),
    home=('HomeView', ('/', '<str:theme>/'),),
)
```

</td></tbody></table>


You can choose `name` defined patterns using `paths_named()`, or alternatively `ClassViewName` pattern using `paths_dict()`

```py
from trim import urls

trim_patterns = dict(
    NoteIndexView=('index', ''),
    EntryJsonList=('entity-list-json', 'entry/list/json/',),
    EntryDetailView=('entry-detail-json', '<str:pk>/json/', ),
)

# No change to the loadout.
urlpatterns = urls.paths_dict(views, trim_patterns)
```

Perform Full includes through single entries, each expand to the conventional include:

<table>
<thead><tr>
  <th align="left">Before</th>
  <th align="left">After</th>
</tr></thead>
<tbody><tr valign="top"><td>

```py
from django.urls import include, path

urlpatterns = [
    path("account/", include("account.urls")),
    path("products/", include("products.urls")),
    path("contact/", include("contact.urls")),
    ...
]
```

</td><td>


```py
urlpatterns = urls.path_includes(
        'account',
        'products',
        'contact',
        ...
    )
```

</td></tbody></table>


And so much more! All designed to trim your code for readability and us lazy fingers.

## Philosophy

I aim for the _Trim_ philosophy "convenient and thoughtless" - where a function or method should be quick to type, until I'm ready to replace them with the django builtins.
