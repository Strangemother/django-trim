## Some Features

Django trim is a facade to the common features of Django providing a layer of sugar for all those daily components. Some quick examples to quickly trim your code:

| Thing | Bits |
| --- | --- |
| Models    | [Auto Model Mixin](./docs/models/auto_model_mixin.md) \| [Fields](./docs/models/fields.md) \| [Live String](./docs/models/live.md) |
| Views     | [Authed Views](./docs/views/authed-views.md) \| [List View](./docs/views/listview.md) \| [JSON Views](./docs/views/serialized.md) |
| Forms     | [quickforms](./docs/forms/quickforms.md) \| [`{% quickform %}` tag](./docs/template/tags/quickform.md) |
| URLs      | [named urls](./docs/urls.md)  |
| Admin     | [`register_models`](./docs/admin.md)  |
| Templates | [`{% link %}` tag](./docs/templates/tags/link.md) \| [`{% wrap %}` tag](./docs/templates/tags/wrap.md) \| [`{% slot %}` Tag](./docs/templates/tags/wrap-slots.md) |
| _Execute_ | [`read_one`](./docs/execute.md)

`django-trim` shortcuts a wealth of fun django parts. All are designed to trim your code without effort. Some of our favourite features:

---

### Models

Use `trim.models.fields` for easy to grab model fields:


```py
from trim.models import fields


class HenBasket(models.Model):
    """A Stock change example """

    # ForeignKey to another model.
    chicken = fields.fk(Chicken)
    user = fields.user_fk()
    # Standard Fields
    full = fields.bool_false()
    other = fields.text()
    eggs = fields.int(6)
    # A datetime pair; created, updated.
    created, updated = fields.dt_cu_pair()
```

All `trim.models.fields` shadow the standard Django field. They are designed to be completely interchangable.

---

### Views

Simplify your class-based-view Generation with a single-point imports and trimmed extras:

```py
from trim import views # All views available
from . import models

class MyModelListView(views.ListView, views.Permissioned):
    model = models.MyModel
    permission_required = 'stocks.view_stockingmethod'


class AddressDetailView(views.UserOwnedMixin, views.DetailView):
    user_field = 'creator'
    user_allow_staff = True

    model = models.Address
    ...
```

---

### Forms

Instantly install prepared forms into a view, utilising the form built-into the class-based `FormView`:

```jinja
{% load quickforms %}

<form>
{% quickform "app:formview-name" %} <!-- synonymous to {{ form.as_ul }} -->
</form>

{% quickform.form "app:formview-name" %} <!-- Ready to go POST form -->
```

---

### URLs

Looking for instantly readable URLs, connected to your class based views?

```py
from trim import urls
from . import views

app_name = 'website'

trim_patterns = dict(
    MyModelListView='',
    AddressDetailView='<str:pk>/',
    ...
    CreateView=('create', 'new/'),             # Use named urls: website:create
    UpdateView=('update', 'change/<str:pk>/'), # Paths are Paths!
    DeleteView='delete/<str:pk>/',             # _JUST_ a URL? Cool
)

urlpatterns = trims.paths_dict(views, trim_patterns)
```

---

### Admin

Instantly and automatically generate admin views for all your models

```py
from django.contrib import admin
from trim import admin as t_admin

from . import models

t_admin.register_models(models)
```

---

### Template Tags

#### Wrap Tag

Generate `wrap` templates to import into your view:

```jinja2
{% load wrap slot %}

{% wrap "wraps/target.html" %}
    {% slot %}
        <p>Replace the default content with alternative HTML,
        no slot names needed.</p>
    {% endslot %}
{% endwrap %}
```

#### Link Tag

Generate a hyperlink to a view with `{% link viewname arguments label %}`

```jinja2
{% load link %}
{% link "appname:viewname" %}
```

And so much more! All designed to trim your code for readability and us lazy fingers.



## Philosophy

I aim for the _Trim_ philosophy "convenient and thoughtless" - where a function or method should be quick to type, until I'm ready to replace them with the django builtins.
