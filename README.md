## Setup

Install Django Trim from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/django-trim/) and add it to your Django project:

```bash
pip install django-trim
```

### Install

In your `settings.py`, include `trim` in `INSTALLED_APPS`:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ...
    'trim',
    # ...
]
```

Thatâ€™s it!

### Minimal Example:

Django trim covers all the chunky parts, allowing you to rapidly run with your ideas without magic or sacrificing clarity.

Here's a fast example for a hen basket model:

```py
# models.py
from django.db import models
from trim.models import fields

class HenBasket(models.Model):
    chicken = fields.fk('Chicken')
    owner = fields.user_fk()
    full = fields.bool_false()
    eggs = fields.int(6) # args default.
    created, updated = fields.dt_cu_pair()
```

```py
# views.py
from trim import views
from .models import Product

class HenBasketListView(views.ListView):
    model = HenBasket


class HenBasketDetailView(views.DetailView):
    model = HenBasket
```

```py
# urls.py
from trim import urls
from . import views

app_name = 'baskets'

urlpatterns = urls.paths_named(views,
    list=('HenBasketListView', ('', 'baskets/'),),
    detail=('HenBasketDetailView', 'baskets/<str:pk>/',),
)
```


## Highlights and Features

`django-trim` respects Django's core principles, adding a layer of convenience for developers who love Django's power but want to type lss wrds.

+ Less typed text, same functionality
+ clear, predicable functional naming
+ Leverage conventions for faster prototyping
+ 100% compatible with existing Django components.

Head to the [docs/ for a list of components](./docs/), Some of our favourite features:

## Models

Use `trim.models` for easy to grab model fields, shortcuts, and fancy non-magic magic.


+ **Functional field helpers** - import fields and create model fields with fewer keystrokes. They shadow the standard Django field classes and are fully interchangeable.
+ **Auto composition** - mix behaviour across apps into existing models without modifying their definitions.
+ **Live model access** - lazy access to any installed model via `trim.live.myapp.ModelName`; no circular imports.

### Function Model Fields

All django fields have functional (guessable) names. Plus a few shortcuts to trim down those chars!

```py
from trim.models import fields


class HenBasket(models.Model):
    # ForeignKey to another model.
    chicken = fields.fk(Chicken)
    user = fields.user_fk()
    # Standard Fields
    full = fields.bool_false()
    other = fields.text()
    eggs = fields.int(6)
    # A datetime pair; created, updated.
    created, updated = fields.dt_cu_pair()
```

> [!TIP]
> All `trim.models.fields` shadow the standard Django field and completely interchangable. [Read more in Fields](./docs/models/fields.md)

### Auto Composition

> Hoist model mixins automatically, from any installed app.

Put this anywhere (Perhaps in a fancy `shopping_addons` tool)

```py
# shopping_addons.models
from trim.models import AutoModelMixin

class StockPriceAutoMixin(AutoModelMixin):
    """Add "pricing" functionality to a "Stock" model
    """

    def get_price(self, vat=.13):
        return self.stock_price + (self.stock_price * vat)

    class Meta:
        # The target app 'baskets' and its model 'Cart'
        model_name = 'stocks.Stock'
```

```py
# Using the hoisted model
>>> from stocks.models import Stock
>>> stock = Stock(id=100)
>>> stock.stock_price # existing django field
10
>>> stock.get_price(.33) # Auto mixin.
13.3
```

It works with any model, allowing you to apply methods on models without manipulating the original model definition (such as the `User` model)

+ [Auto Model Mixin](./docs/models/auto_model_mixin.md)


### Live Model Access

> The `trim.live` models access provides a shortcut to your all installed your models without the need to import such as `trim.live.users.User()`

This allows you to call upon a model **when required**, not in the runtime startup. Allowing you to call upon _late models_ without the circular hell.

Gather any model using standard dotted notation `trim.live.myapp.ModelName`

```py
from trim import live

# Import any existing model from any app!
MyModel = live.myapp.ModelName

MyModel()
```

You never need to `import` your models. Take a look in [Live String Docs](./docs/models/live.md)

## Views

> Django Trim embraces class-based-views and bundles a set of useful integration mixins and trim tools


### Instant View Permissioning

Simplify your class-based-view Generation with a single-point imports and trimmed extras:

```py
from trim import views # All views available
from . import models

class MyModelListView(views.ListView, views.Permissioned):
    model = models.MyModel
    permission_required = 'stocks.view_stockingmethod'


class AddressDetailView(views.UserOwnedMixin, views.DetailView):
    user_field = 'creator'
    user_allow_staff = True

    model = models.Address
    ...
```

### JSON Views

Quick and dirty JSON views wired into the django tooling

```py
from trim.views import JsonView, JsonListView, JsonDetailView

class ExampleJsonListView(JsonListView):
    # A list of JSON objects /items/
    model = models.MyModel

class ExampleJsonDetailView(JsonDetailView):
    # A single object, /items/<str:pk>/
    model = models.MyModel
```

Or just role your own:

```py
class ExampleJsonView(JsonView):
    """ returns:
        {
            "object": {
                "hello": "world"
            }
        }
    """
    def get_data(self):
        return {'hello': 'world'}
```

### Markdown Views

> Bored of writing HTML? Directly use markdown as templates

Django Trim offers a markdown block and some tags - for instant markdown:

```jinja
{% load markdown %}

<div>
    {% markdown %}
    # Markdown Block.

    Write markdown content within the template directly.
    {% endmarkdown %}
</div>
```

A markdown template response class for full markdown templating:

```py
from trim import views
from trim.markdown.response import MarkdownTemplateResponse

class MarkdownReponseIndexView(views.TemplateView):
    response_class = MarkdownTemplateResponse
    template_name = "contact/index.md"
```

## Forms

Forms can be tedious. Django Trim offers functional fields, site-wide form template tags and more.

### Zero Config, Any Time, Plugged Correctly.

Instantly install prepared forms into a view, utilising the form built-into the class-based `FormView`:

```jinja
{% load quickforms %}

{# A rendered form, posted to /myapp/formview-name/ #}
{% quickform.form "app:formview-name" %} <!-- Ready to go POST form -->


<form>
{% quickform "app:formview-name" %} <!-- synonymous to {{ form.as_ul }} -->
</form>

```

It's wired to your existing view (`app:formview-name`) Allowing you to build **one form endpoint** and use the form **everywhere**.


## URLs

> Managing the `urls.py` can be ugly in large apps. Django Trim helps with un-uglification for us lazy trimmers.

### Easy Readable URL Definitions

> Looking for instantly readable URLs? Trim it of course...

One of our favourite features is the _named_ style urls, where the keyword parameter is our `template_name`

```py
from trim.urls import paths_named
from . import views

app_name = 'screenshots'

urlpatterns = [] +  paths_named(views,
    # {% link "screenshots:index" "Index Page" %}
    index=('ScreenshotIndexView', '',),
    create=('ScreenshotFormView', 'new/',),
    form_success=('ScreenshotFormSuccessView', 'success/<str:id>/',),

    # {% link "screenshots:info" object.id "Screenshot Info" %}
    info=('ScreenshotRequestUpdateView', 'info/<str:id>/',),
)
```

> But perhaps a dictionary or tuple of URLs, connected to your class based views?

Dictionary flavour definitions, using the ClassName as the key:

```py
from trim import urls
from . import views

app_name = 'website'

trim_patterns = dict(
    MyModelListView='',
    AddressDetailView='<str:pk>/',
    ...
    CreateView=('create', 'new/'),             # Use named urls: website:create
    UpdateView=('update', 'change/<str:pk>/'), # Paths are Paths!
    DeleteView='delete/<str:pk>/',             # _JUST_ a URL? Cool
)

urlpatterns = urls.paths_dict(views, trim_patterns)
```

Or maybe a more pure `tuple` of `tuples`:

```py
from trim import urls
from . import views

app_name = 'website'

trim_patterns = (
    ('NoteIndexView', 'index', '' ),
    ('EntryJsonList', 'entity-list-json', 'entry/list/json/' ),
    ('EntryDetailView', 'entry-detail-json', '<str:pk>/json/' ),
)

urlpatterns = urls.paths_tuple(views, trim_patterns)
```

## Admin

Instantly and automatically generate admin views for all your models

```py
from django.contrib import admin
from trim import admin as t_admin

from . import models

# register all models in this app.
t_admin.register_models(models)
```

## Template Tags

### Wrap Tag

Slottable, Importable, _includes_ with the `wrap` tag:

```jinja
{% load wrap slot %}

{% wrap "wraps/target.html" %}
    {% slot %}
        <p>Replace the default content with alternative HTML,
        no slot names needed.</p>
    {% endslot %}
{% endwrap %}
```

### Link Tag

Generate a hyperlink to a view with `{% link viewname arguments label %}`

```jinja
{% load link %}
{% link "appname:viewname" "Click this link!" %}
```

[And so much more](./docs/)!

## Philosophy

I aim for the _Trim_ philosophy "convenient and thoughtless" - where a function or method should be quick to type, until I'm ready to replace them with the django builtins.
